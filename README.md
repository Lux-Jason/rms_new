### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rms_new.git
   ```

2. **Database Configuration**

   - Import the SQL file located in the `/db` directory to set up the database schema.
   - Update the `connectdb.php` file with your database credentials.

3. **Environment Configuration**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

     ```plaintext
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_USER=root
     DB_PASS=your_password
     DB_NAME=rms_new_db
     ```

4. **Start the Server**

   - Use a local server like XAMPP or MAMP to run the project.
   - Ensure the server is configured to use the correct PHP version.
   - Navigate to the project directory and start the server.

### Access the Application

- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/rms_new`.
- Use the default credentials for testing:
  - **Username**: `admin`
  - **Password**: `password`

## Code Structure

- **/src**: Contains the main PHP source code.
- **/public**: Publicly accessible files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **/db**: Database scripts and migrations.
- **connectdb.php**: Manages the database connection using PDO.

## Code Explanation

### Database Connection (`connectdb.php`)

```php
<?php
$dsn = 'mysql:host=' . getenv('DB_HOST') . ';dbname=' . getenv('DB_NAME');
$options = [
    PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,
    PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => PDO::FETCH_ASSOC,
];

try {
    $conn = new PDO($dsn, getenv('DB_USER'), getenv('DB_PASS'), $options);
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    error_log('Database connection error: ' . $e->getMessage());
    die('Database connection failed.');
}
?>
```

### Main Script (`index.php`)

- [Provide a brief explanation of the main logic and flow of this script.]

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Error**: Ensure your database credentials are correct in the `.env` file.
- **Page Not Loading**: Check that the web server is running and the correct PHP version is configured.
